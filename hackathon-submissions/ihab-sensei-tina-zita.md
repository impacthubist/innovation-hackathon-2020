## Description
Our solution is a Supply-Chain Management System that contains five main categories which are Admin Dashboard, Inventory, Orders, Recipes, and Bills.
The system helps Tina-Zita to manage their inventory.
It tracks the remaining amount when order is received and adds amount when something is added to stock.

The admin can see some additional features in Admin-Dashboard like trending recipes, expiring products, products out of stock, today's orders, notes 
and monthly summary of their business.
The order tab helps the user to add new orders they received and all orders they have had throughout the day. When a new order is added, 
the ingredients for the orders are automatically subtracted from the inventory.
In the recipes section, admin can collect their recipes, can add/edit new recipes with a form that is specialized for adding necessary ingredients separately.
Lastly,  the bills tab section helps the user to see their supplier bills as a collection. Users can add and edit new bills to the system.
Given enough time, this system can be loaded with many functionalities in the future.
