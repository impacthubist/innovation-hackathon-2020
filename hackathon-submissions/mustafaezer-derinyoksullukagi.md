## Deep Poverty Network

We Çimenev volunteers is a community that was established in December 2019 to provide food needs, which are the most basic rights and needs, to dozens of poor neighborhoods in the field of urban poverty through supporters.

## Our Purpose

With the increasing needs of food and hygiene during the pandemic process, need for the deep poverty network has also increased. Yet, there is no cash flow and fundraising. In this project our main aim is to digitize this process and make sure that individuals who want to support can deliver food and hygienic material support directly to families in need, without sharing their personal information (e.g. name, address) of the families with supporters, via online order. With this process, supporters can follow their support and products delivered directly to families in need.

## How Does Our Project Work?

Users:
1-Admin User: Deep Poverty Network
2-Other Users: Supporters (No login needed)

Admin will list the needs of families in their profile. In these profiles items will be shown with their product names, quantities and prices. After supporters choose their virtual market such as "Migros Sanal Market", they can support families by paying their packages.

## What We Need in the Long Term?

After the meetings that we held with our stakeholder Deep Poverty Network, we concluded that we need partnerships with the supermarkets with virtual stores (e.g. Migros, A101). Because the partnerships have not been created yet, we placed dummy data in our code (just for now) to be replaced after getting into partnerships. In order to replace this dummy data with the real ones, we need the APIs of those partner supermarkets. Those APIs are essential to not to expose the addresses of the families to the supporters. (in parallel with our primary purpose) Before making this decision, we discussed with the Deep Poverty Network. They stated that they are also planning to get into partnerships in the long term and it would be wonderful if we are able to integrate them to the platform.
