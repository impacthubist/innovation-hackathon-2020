i) ONARANLAR (Team Fazl)

ii)--General Purpose of Project:This project aims that digitalize the onaranlar's bussines and make smarter. In this application we combined user friendly design and user interest on app. The app allows us post the place where onaranlar members can hack(can fix) with description,location etc... Also Onaranlar members can take task from this app and when they compelete the hack(fixing process) they will earn some points. And with this points they can buy food for street animals(they need a sponsorship in this point). As a summary this app will courage the members to gain points but at the some time they will hack the urban(fix the city) according the priorities and locaitons.

--Rank Page:This page show us who has more points and on the right top corner there is a button which
allows us the arrange our profile.

--Task Page:In this page we can see task sorted according to priority also DON'T FORGET TO CLICK ON TASK (it will open a modal).
Also from this page on corner button we can add tasks too.

--Reward Page:That page shows us what the users can buy for street animals but onaranlar needs a
sponsorhip for this.
